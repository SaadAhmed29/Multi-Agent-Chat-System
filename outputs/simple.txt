Answer:
Found information:
cnn:
  Convolutional Neural Networks - specialized for image processing with convolutional layers
  Pros: Excellent for image tasks, Parameter sharing reduces complexity, Highly efficient
  Cons: Requires large datasets, Computationally intensive training, Less suitable for sequential data

rnn:
  Recurrent Neural Networks - specialized for sequential data with feedback connections
  Pros: Handles variable length sequences, Captures temporal dependencies, Memory of past inputs
  Cons: Slow training, Vanishing gradient problem, Limited long-term memory

transformer:
  Self-attention based architecture - foundation of modern NLP using multi-head attention mechanisms
  Pros: Parallelizable training, Captures long-range dependencies, State-of-the-art performance
  Cons: High computational cost, Large memory requirements, Complex architecture

gan:
  Generative Adversarial Networks - for generating synthetic data through adversarial training
  Pros: Generates realistic data, Unsupervised learning, Creative applications
  Cons: Unstable training, Mode collapse issues, Difficult to evaluate

lstm:
  Long Short-Term Memory - improved RNN for long-term dependencies with gating mechanisms
  Pros: Solves vanishing gradient problem, Long-term memory, Better than basic RNN
  Cons: Slower than CNN, Still limited very long sequences, More parameters than RNN

Confidence: 80.00%
