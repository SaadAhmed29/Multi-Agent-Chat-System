Answer:
Found information:
gradient descent:
  Basic optimization algorithm that iteratively moves in direction of negative gradient
  Pros: Simple, Widely used, Works well for convex problems
  Cons: Can be slow, May get stuck in local minima, Needs learning rate tuning

adam:
  Adaptive learning rate optimization combining momentum and RMSprop
  Pros: Fast convergence, Adaptive learning rates, Robust to noisy data
  Cons: More memory intensive, Can diverge in some cases, Complex hyperparameters

sgd:
  Stochastic Gradient Descent updates weights using random samples
  Pros: Fast, Memory efficient, Good generalization
  Cons: Noisy updates, Requires learning rate scheduling, Less stable

rmsprop:
  Root Mean Square Propagation - adapts learning rate based on magnitude of gradients
  Pros: Works well with RNNs, Adaptive learning rates, Stable
  Cons: Sensitive to learning rate, Less intuitive, Not always fastest

momentum:
  Accumulates gradient information over time with momentum term
  Pros: Faster convergence, Reduces oscillations, Better generalization
  Cons: Extra hyperparameter, May overshoot, Requires tuning

Confidence: 80.00%
Agent Contributions: Research completed, Comparison/Analysis completed
